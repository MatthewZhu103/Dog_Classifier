As a fun learning experience, I implemented a Binary CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) Classifier to identify my two dogs given images of both of them. All concepts are explained in the Juypter Notebook code
I took all 205 images of my dogs as data and put it through 9 layers to process and classify them
